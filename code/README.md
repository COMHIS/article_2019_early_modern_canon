## Python

Python code has been written for Python 3.6. Required libraries can be found in `requirements_py.txt`. Install them by `pip install -r requirements_py.txt` (preferably in a Python virtual environment).


## Data prep code

To create the processed data needed by the python scripts, and possibly others run `data_prep_main.py`. This script needs the `data/work/canon.csv` processed data file. Other required dataset are in `data/raw`.
